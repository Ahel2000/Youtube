# The application will allow one to download videos directly from youtube. Though there are multiple sites like savefromnet.in(I do not that everyone is aware of those sites) which allows users to download videos from YouTube, having an application of my own is exciting.The youtube link of your desired video can be pasted between the quotes of the variable link in the first cell of the file after deleting the link already written there. On running all the cells,the video will be downloaded and the address in which it gets stored will also displayed.
